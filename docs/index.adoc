== Current state as of 2022-01-25

1. Jenkins-tests fail
2. zBeni working on same project?
3. tested various environments:
- local (runs, but tests always fail)
- Oracle always-free VM (always crashed during startup)
- Raspberry Pi 3 (ran fine, but crashed once)
- Oracle VM with more resources (runs, but had issues with port-forwarding)
4. Started creating Dockerfile
5. Started evaluating jenkins errors

== 2022-01-31 Jenkins fix implemented
We found a fix for jenkins, detailed documentation can be found here:
<<jenkins-fix.adoc#_issue,Jenkins-Fix-Doc>>

== Report 2022-02-07
In cooperation with the 5ahif-LeoCode-Team we managed to
fix various issues on the LeoCode-Virtual-Machine (vm147).

It is now possible to write code in the integrated monaco-editor and submit it. The code-file then gets forwarded to our testing-api which opens up a new jenkins-runner that tests the submission. If all tests go according to plan, the test-result 'SUCCESS' is displayed on our frontend. If the tests fail, or an error occurs because of a faulty submission, the frontend shows 'FAILED' or 'ERROR'.

We identified some performance issues regarding the testing-api which seem to be caused by the testing-process taking place in jenkins.
